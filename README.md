#### Projects

In this repository, I have done two projects that are:

###### Face detection

 Face detection means only detecting the face in the image or video. In this project, I have used **Haars Cascade Model File** that comes pre-build for open-cv.

###### Face Recognition
Face recognition means that we have to detect the face and identify it according to the data we have provided to the model to train it. The data used in this project is taken from Kaggle and I used Haars Cascade Model Again.

**Note:** These projects don't have too much accuracy and are not for development. These projects are only for learning purposes.
