#### Projects

In this repository I have done two projects that are:

###### Face detection

    Face detection means only detecting the face that is in the image or video. In this project I have used**Haars Cascade Model File** that come pre-build for open-cv.

###### Face Recognition

    Face recognition means that we have to detect the face and also identify the face according to the data that we have provided to the model to train it. The data used in this project is taken from kaggle and I used Haars Cascade Model Again.

**Note:** These projects don't have too much accuracy and are not for development. These projects are only for learning purpose.
